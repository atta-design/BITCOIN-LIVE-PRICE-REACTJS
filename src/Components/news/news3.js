              HONG KONG, May 21 (Reuters) - China will crack down on bitcoin
              mining and trading activities as part of efforts to fend off
              financial risks, the State Council's Financial Stability and
              Development Committee said on Friday.

              The country will also clamp down on illegal activities in the
              securities market, and maintain the stability of stock, bond
              and forex markets, the committee said in a meeting chaired by
              Vice Premier Liu He.

              The statement, which comes just days after three Chinese
              industry bodies tightened a ban on banks and payment companies
              providing crypto-related services, marks a sharp escalation of
              moves against virtual currencies. read more

              Liu is the most senior Chinese official to publicly order a
              crackdown on bitcoin, and it is the first time the state
              council has explicitly targeted crypto mining activities.

              Bitcoin prices fell sharply again on the news and are on

              Bitcoin prices fell sharply again on the news and are on
              course for weekly losses of more tha n 15%, as is Etherium .
              Investor protection and prevention of money laundering are
              particular concerns of governments a nd financial regulators
              who are grappling with whether and how they should regulate
              the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier, Hong Kong proposed the
              city's market regulator license cryptocurrency exchanges and
              only allow them to provide services to professional investors.

              "While some degree of crypto regulation is inevitable, these
              overly restrictive policies will result in stifled opportunity
              and industry flight away from Asia," said Jehan Chu, managing
              partner at Hong Kong blockchain venture capital firm Kenetic
              Capital.

              China's state broadcaster CCTV on Friday warned against
              "systemic risks" of cryptocurrency trading in a commentary on
              its website. "Bitcoin is no longer an investment tool to avoid
              risks. Rather, it's a speculative instrument," the broadcaster
              said, adding the cryptocurrency is a lightly-regulated asset
              often used in black market trade, money-laundering, arms
              smuggling, gambling and drug dealings.
