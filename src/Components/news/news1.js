            <p>
              A blockchain indicator tracking the flow of coins in and out
              of centralized exchanges is signaling a bearish shift in
              investor sentiment similar to the one seen before the May 2021
              crash.

                  Glassnode data shows the 90-day moving average of net
                  exchange flows has turned positive, meaning more coins are
                  entering exchanges than leaving.

                  Sustained net inflows, if any, would be a cause for
                  concern for the bulls.

                  Net inflows imply investor intention to sell, while
                  consistent outflows represent strong holding sentiment and
                  take out circulating supply from the market, paving the
                  way for price rallies.

                  The metric consistently signaled outflows with a negative
                  print throughout bitcoin’s 10-fold rally to over $60,000
                  observed in 11 months to April 2021.

                  A similar pattern was observed in October 2021 when
                  bitcoin rallied 40% to new record highs above $65,000.

                  The Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes and the
                  U.S. jobs data scheduled for release later this week may
                  inject volatility into the bitcoin market.

                  According to FXStreet, the U.S. economy is expected to
                  have added 400,000 jobs in December after November’s
                  210,000 additions. Strong data may strengthen the dollar
                  and weight over bitcoin and asset prices, in general.
