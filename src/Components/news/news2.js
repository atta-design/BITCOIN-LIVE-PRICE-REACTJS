            The Indian government is reportedly making additional changes to
            the country’s crypto bill. The bill, which is listed for the
            current session of parliament, may be taken up in the budget
            session instead. According to reports, the government could also
            “consider bringing an ordinance or special order after the
            session.”

              The government of India is reportedly planning to make
              additional changes to the crypto bill. The “Cryptocurrency and
              Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021” is
              currently listed to be considered in the winter session of
              parliament.

              However, a senior government official told Business Today
              Thursday that the government is considering reworking the bill
              and will likely introduce it in the budget session in
              February. According to the unnamed official:
            </p>
            <p>
              Discussions are ongoing and key issues like the treatment of
              private cryptocurrencies, the rationale of regulation and
              global practices is being looked into once again.

              The Indian government calls all cryptocurrencies that are not
              issued by the central bank “private cryptocurrencies,”
              including bitcoin and ether.

              In addition, NDTV similarly reported Wednesday that the
              government is planning to make some changes to the bill.
              Citing unnamed sources, the publication said the government
              wants India’s crypto regulation to be in tandem with the
              global framework but does not want to rush on the crypto law.
              The news outlet added:
            </p>
            <p>
              More changes are likely in the crypto bill … and the Centre
              might consider bringing an ordinance or special order after
              the session.
